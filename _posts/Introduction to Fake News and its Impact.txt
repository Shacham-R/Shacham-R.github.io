"Fake news" refers to false or misleading information presented as if it were true, often created with the intent to deceive or manipulate readers. This misinformation can be spread through various channels, including traditional media, social media platforms, websites, and other online sources. Fake news can take many forms, such as fabricated stories, misleading headlines, distorted facts, or manipulated images and videos.

It's important to note that fake news is different from unintentional errors in reporting or genuine mistakes made by journalists. Fake news is typically created with the intention to deceive and can have serious consequences, influencing public opinion, elections, and even contributing to social unrest. Identifying and combating fake news has become a significant challenge in the age of digital information and social media.
